layout.bmp is missing currently.

if you have anything thats not Paint you can go ahead and make one, needs to be placed in 
ConsoleDungeonCrawler\ConsoleDungeonCrawler\bin\Debug

The correct one will be up tomorrow though, so this really doesnt matter.

Can also switch the level generation in Application.NewGame() back to LevelGenerator (from LevelFromImage)
